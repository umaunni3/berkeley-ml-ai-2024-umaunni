This is my capstone project for the Berkeley ML/AI professional certificate course.

**Research question:** Can we predict how well a video game will sell based on factors like genre, platform, publisher, and so on? And how do sales vary across different markets (US, JP, etc) based on these same attributes?

 

**Expected data sources:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/baynebrannen/video-game-sales-2020

 

**Expected techniques:** support vector regression, linear regression, k-means (for clustering across markets)

 

**Expected results:** Identifying key factors that drive video game commercial success, and possibly variations in these factors when looking at different markets  (US, JP, etc). Development of a model to predict sales metrics for a new game (# copies sold, overall profit) based on key attributes such as genre, developer, release time, etc. 

 

**Why this question is important:** The video game development industry has grown significantly over the last few decades, and especially in the years following 2020. Development studios have a clear interest in identifying which types of games are most likely to bring in revenue. Knowing how much revenue a game can be expected to earn can also help studios determine what kind of development budget they should allocate to upcoming games.
